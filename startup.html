<h2>This is an interactive demo of the developer DSi Shop.</h2>The developer DSi shop uses a modified version of the DSi Browser, and most of its content is local HTML/JS. Because the app is almost entirely HTML/JS, I was able to take the HTML pages from romfs and format them to work on your browser.<br><br>Sadly, many of the pages are missing- locked behind Nintendo's development servers or just straight up gone. I patched things up wherever possible, killing any dead links and linking to otherwise unlinked pages.<br>Features such as the console information and DSi specific operations are also missing/broken (as is to be expected when running a DSi app on a modern browser). I tried filling in the blanks where I could, but it still has a way to go.<br>If you want to help polish up the code, feel free to submit a PR <a href="https://github.com/IanSkinner1982/ianskinner1982.github.io/tree/master/dsidev/dsishop">here.</a><br>
<h2>Download original app:</h2>
I have found 3 different versions of this app. I am not sure what the specific differences between the apps are, though I will look into that.<br>
I used the files from <i><b>shop.HNFC.Release.v1536</b></i> for my demo.

<br><br><span style="color:orange;">
<i><b>shop.HNFC.Release.v1536.tad</b></i> is the only working version of the debug shop. It will only run if installed to NAND and booted via the home menu.<br>Using nds-bootstrap, unlaunch, or any similar apps will introduce problems like dead touch controls, a <b>293003</b> error, or cause the shop to whitescreen.</span>
